A space themed scrolling shooter.

Still being improved in my free time.

Description: This is a space themed scrolling shooter featuring different weapons, powerups, and enemies. 
Players start the game with a splash screen where they enter their name. Names are compared to a "blacklist" 
in an attempt to filter bad words. The player is made aware of a bad name and has to enter another. They 
then advance to the game. Enemies and the terrain spawn randomly with a boss appearing after a certain 
amount of kills. Additional weapons can be found throughout the game. The player plays the game until they 
die. Scores are saved locally in a text file along with the player's name. All images and sounds are 
copyright free material or made by myself.

Story: This started as a project I was working on in my free time becuase I did not feel challenged by the 
work we did in class. When the requirement for a final project was announced I decided to keep working on 
this and submit it as my project. I made many improvements to it and submitted a fairly impressive project 
considering I taught myself most of the material and found the resources(music, pictures, banned words) as 
free material online. However, I still think the program can be improved and I continue to improve it as I 
have time. One day it may become an app.
