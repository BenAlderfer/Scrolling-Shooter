A space themed scrolling shooter.

This is a space themed scrolling shooter featuring different weapons, powerups, and enemies.
Players start the game with a splash screen where they enter their name. Names are compared to a "blacklist"
in an attempt to filter bad words. The player is made aware of a bad name and has to enter another. They
then advance to the game. Enemies and the terrain spawn randomly with a boss appearing after a certain
amount of kills. Additional weapons can be found throughout the game. The player plays the game until they
die. Scores are saved locally in a text file along with the player's name. All images and sounds are
copyright free material or made by myself.

Background: This started as a project I was working on in my free time in high school becuase I did not feel challenged by the
work we did in class. When the requirement for a final project was announced I decided to keep working on
this and submit it as my project. I made many improvements to it and submitted an impressive project
considering I taught myself most of the material and found the resources (music, pictures, blacklist words) as
free material online.
